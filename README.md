## üëã Introduction
### Description
The objective of this github repository is to be able to find the weather forecast for a place. For this, in the one page the user must enter information concerning this place: the address and the postal code.

### Technologies
To create this one page we used these 3 languages:
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS)

### Useful links
Here are the different links we used to help us create this one page :
* [Weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
* [API Adresse](https://geo.api.gouv.fr/adresse)
* [Request weather api](http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json)
* [Address search request](https://api-adresse.data.gouv.fr/search/)

### The challenges of the projects
During the development of this one page we encountered many challenges.
* One of the principal challenge was to find a good api that we can use freely and with pertinent data.
* The second challenge was to obtain the coordinate for the api so we needed to use a second api.
* The last challenge was to find the good emplacement on the geo-gouv api and for that we decided to propose to propose 3 inputs :
* One for the adress
* One for the city
* One for the postcode
### Future features
In the future, we would like to develop this one page to develop its use.

* Add a map for just click the adress
* Add some interractive images on the data's display
** All good proposition by you, the user*
